# this file defines a pipeline, a set of rules for building and validating the source code in a repo
# it's written in a format called YAML

# trigger defines when the pipeline will run.
# list of branches syntax:
# trigger:
# - main
trigger:
  branches:
    include:
    - master
  paths:
    include:
    - azure-pipelines.yml
    - Project1

# short for "agent pool" as in "build agent"
# i.e. what set of machines will be the build agents to run these steps.
pool:
  vmImage: ubuntu-latest

# variables common to multiple steps
variables:
  sdkVersion: 5.x
  buildConfiguration: Release

# these steps are run in sequence by the build agent,
# in a directory that contains the most recent push on that branch of that repo
# if any step fails, that will halt the build and subsequent steps will not run.

# the two most common types of steps are "script" and "task"
